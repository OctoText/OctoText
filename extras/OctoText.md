# You only need the following if your plugin requires specific OctoPrint versions or
# specific operating systems to function - you can safely remove the whole
# "compatibility" block if this is not the case.

compatibility:

  # List of compatible versions
  #
  # A single version number will be interpretated as a minimum version requirement,
  # e.g. "1.3.1" will show the plugin as compatible to OctoPrint versions 1.3.1 and up.
  # More sophisticated version requirements can be modelled too by using PEP440
  # compatible version specifiers.
  #
  # You can also remove the whole "octoprint" block. Removing it will default to all
  # OctoPrint versions being supported.

  octoprint:
  - 1.4.0

  # List of compatible operating systems
  #
  # Valid values:
  #
  # - windows
  # - linux
  # - macos
  # - freebsd
  #
  # There are also two OS groups defined that get expanded on usage:
  #
  # - posix: linux, macos and freebsd
  # - nix: linux and freebsd
  #
  # You can also remove the whole "os" block. Removing it will default to all
  # operating systems being supported.

  os:
  - linux
  - windows
  - macos
  - freebsd

  # Compatible Python version
  #
  # Plugins should aim for compatibility for Python 2 and 3 for now, in which case the value should be ">=2.7,<4".
  #
  # Plugins that only wish to support Python 3 should set it to ">=3,<4".
  #
  # If your plugin only supports Python 2 (worst case, not recommended for newly developed plugins since Python 2
  # is EOL), leave at ">=2.7,<3" - be aware that your plugin will not be allowed to register on the
  # plugin repository if it only support Python 2.

  python: ">=3,<4"

# OctoText - Simple, Easy to use, Free text or email notifications 
OctoText is a notification plugin that will send you a text or email on configurable printer events. All 
you need is an email account! The printer status - along with a webcam snapshot if configured - will
be sent to you either through email or SMS text message. 

OctoText is not a service, you will never be charged and your information is only stored on the device it
is installed on and never transmitted anywhere for any reason.

## Get optionally notified on the following printer events:
<ul>
   <li> File uploaded</li>
   <li> Print started</li>
   <li> Print done</li>
   <li> Print failure </li>
   <li> Peroidic progress updates </li>
   <li> Error (unrecoverable)</li>
</ul>

# OctoText plugin installation
If you can set up an email account you can configure OctoText!

1. Install the plugin via the [Plugin Manager](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/bundledplugins/pluginmanager.html)
2. Choose an existing email or setup a new email account to be used for the plugin. It is recommended that you use a free
service such as Microsoft's Outlook just for this. The email host will need to allow you to send email
via an SMTP gateway and you will need this information to set up OctoText. 
3. Open the settings tab on Octoprint for the OctoText settings and change the default gateway and port 
for your email hosting service. Outlook uses smtp.office365.com for its gateway and 587 for the port number.
4. Optionally modify the "Message" setting for the test.
5. Change the email address and password settings to match the account you setup. The password is stored securely on 
the OctoPrint server and NEVER transmitted beyond setting up the email connection.
6. For a text message enter the phone number and SMS gateway(1), for email destination enter the username and host.com address
7. If you are going to use the webcam - test the snapshot setting first!
8. Press the test button!

That's it! You will get feedback relatively quickly if the text/email was configured correctly.
The only error case that we cannot detect easily is a bad destination address of the text or email.
